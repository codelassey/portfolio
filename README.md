# $ WHOAMI
I am Prince Kwesi Lassey, an Emerging Cybersecurity Professional with a deep passion for safeguarding digital ecosystems and empowering communities against cyber threats in these evolving times. Through ongoing academic work, I bring a unique analytical perspective to cybersecurity.  I have cultivated a robust skill set in penetration testing, web application security, network security, vulnerability analysis, and incident response through through structured mentorship, intensive bootcamps and hands-on labs. These experiences have equipped me to understand attacker mindsets and defender strategies, enabling me to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and respond effectively to cyber incidents. As I revisit my extensive lab work to document my findings, I share my growth transparently hoping to inspire others beginning their cybersecurity journeys. My journey into cybersecurity was sparked by a personal mission to protect the vulnerable, driven by witnessing the devastating impact of social engineering on a loved one. Currently, Iâ€™m developing a password checker tool which goes beyond strength checks and aims to help users evaluate password strength and detect compromised credentials, promoting stronger cyber hygiene.

# PURPOSE
My long-term vision is to become a versatile Cybersecurity Analyst, specializing in penetration testing, threat detection, incident response, and digital forensics. I am committed to mastering both offensive and defensive security techniques, blending red and blue team expertise to design and implement robust security solutions. By deepening my knowledge in cybersecurity tools and methodologies, I aim to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats and contribute to organizational resilience. Through DigDigiSense initiative, I aim to bridge the digital literacy gap and combat prevalent threats by empowering individuals and organizations with the knowledge and tools to secure their online presence as well as tech tips, making cybersecurity feel personal, achievable, and even fun through creative storytelling. Iâ€™m excited to bring my skills to a dynamic team where I can continue learning, contribute to secure solutions,  pursue internships, and engage in mentorship opportunities to accelerate my growth as a cybersecurity professional and to make a meaningful impact to society. My mission is simple: To defend the vulnerable, protect digital spaces by contributing to cutting-edge security solutions, and building a resilient digital future.
